# se-starter-code

This is the main starter code repository for the Flatpack Coders Software Enigneering Course.

## Note to Students

If the content in the starter code doesn't match the video exactly, please raise an issue in the github repo. (You'll be shown how to do this during the course)

If you don't know how to do that, please email or DM your tech lead on slack with the following details:

- The name of the lesson you're watching (copy and paste it)
- The name of the file that doesn't match (copy and paste it)
- A short description of what's not right

Please be aware that this is not the place to express opinions on what should or shouldn't be included. If you think something's missing, then please get in touch with your tech lead.

## Note to instructors and editors

PRs will only be merged if it matches the video accompaniment perfectly.

Feel free to submit a PR with notes on what (if anything) needs changing in the video content. Every change will be on a case by case basis.

If breaking version changes have come about that require a code change. Make a PR then immediately notify the head of instruction and an urgent change will be queued. SLA for this is 24 hours so be quick.
